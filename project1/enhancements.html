    <h1>Additional Features Upgraded</h1>
    <p>Going beyond the requirements of this project, our team also has added some links connected to pages that we
      think are necessary for the occupations website. On this page, those novel things are mentioned, and there are
      some hyperlinks to websites giving us information. Most of the information about describing job requirements and
      characteristics is generated by ChatGPT because this method is really effective for getting outside information.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Feedback Form</dt>
      <dd>Obviously, there are still mistakes and areas for improvement on this website. No website is perfect from the
        start, and continuous development is essential to ensure a better user experience. One of the most effective
        ways to improve the website successfully is to actively seek and incorporate feedback from users. After all,
        they are the ones interacting with the site daily, and their insights can provide valuable perspectives that
        might otherwise be overlooked.
        <br><br>
        Creating a feedback form allows users to share their opinions, report issues, suggest new features, and express
        their overall experience with the website. This can help identify bugs, design flaws, or usability issues that
        need to be addressed. Additionally, user feedback can highlight areas where the website is performing well,
        reinforcing positive aspects that should be maintained or enhanced.
        <br><br>
        The link to feedback form appears in the section "Description of this website" in homepage. <br>
        Here is the direct link to it: <a href="feedback.html">Feedback form</a>

      <dt>Groups of jobs</dt>
      <dd>As our company continues to grow and expand, we have decided to establish a new branch, which requires a
        diverse range of job opportunities to accommodate the needs of this evolving environment. A successful business
        relies on a variety of skilled professionals across different industries, ensuring that all essential roles are
        covered to maintain efficiency and innovation. To support this expansion, we have integrated multiple
        occupations into our website, making it easier for job seekers to explore relevant career opportunities based on
        their expertise and interests.
        <br><br>
        However, with the increasing number of job listings on our website, we recognized the potential challenge of
        navigating through a vast array of opportunities. Having an extensive list of jobs on a single page can be
        overwhelming, making it difficult for applicants to quickly identify and differentiate between roles in various
        fields. To address this issue, we implemented an additional horizontal navigation system that enhances user
        experience and streamlines the job search process.
        <br><br>
        To access these groups, just click the fields on the horizontal navigation on every pages. <br>
        These are also direct links to them: <a href="job_description/CS/cs.html">Computer Science</a>, <a
          href="job_description/Business/business.html">Business</a>, <a
          href="job_description/Media/media.html">Media</a>.
      </dd>

      <br>

      <dt>Links to particular jobs</dt>
      <dd>As our company grows and continues to expand, we are constantly striving to enhance our job application system
        to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for job seekers. While the introduction of categorized job
        fields has helped users navigate specific industries with ease, we recognize that further improvements are
        necessary to refine the job browsing process.
        <br><br>
        Currently, our jobs page contains 18 different occupations, each offering unique opportunities across Computer
        Science, Business, and Media. However, we have found that listing all these occupations on a single page can
        still be overwhelming for users. A large number of job postings in one place can make it difficult for
        applicants to quickly find the exact position they are interested in. To address this concern and enhance
        clarity, we have decided to create dedicated pages for each individual job.
        <br><br>

      <dt>Tips for applicants</dt>
      <dd>A well-crafted CV is one of the most critical components of a job application. It serves as
        the first impression that a hiring manager or recruiter has of an applicant, and it plays a significant role in
        determining whether a candidate progresses to the interview stage. Recognizing the importance of a strong and
        compelling CV, we have taken the initiative to provide job seekers with valuable guidance on improving their
        resumes.
        <br><br>
        In our commitment to helping applicants succeed, we have added a dedicated "CV Tips" page to our website. This
        page serves as a comprehensive resource where users can access detailed suggestions and best practices curated
        by our company’s hiring professionals.
        <br><br>
        The 9 tips are taken from "danaher": <br>
